Subject: [PATCH 0818/2236] drm/amdgpu: Remove redundant I2C EEPROM address

Remove redundant EEPROM_I2C_MADDR_54H address, since we already have it
represented (ARCTURUS), and since we don't include the I2C device type
identifier in EEPROM memory addresses, i.e. that high up in the device
abstraction--we only use EEPROM memory addresses, as memory is continuously
represented by EEPROM device(s) on the I2C bus.

Add a comment describing what these memory addresses are, how they come
about and how they're usually extracted from the device address byte.

+/* These are memory addresses as would be seen by one or more EEPROM
+ * chips strung on the I2C bus, usually by manipulating pins 1-3 of a
+ * set of EEPROM devices. They form a continuous memory space.
+ *
+ * The I2C device address includes the device type identifier, 1010b,
+ * which is a reserved value and indicates that this is an I2C EEPROM
+ * device. It also includes the top 3 bits of the 19 bit EEPROM memory
+ * address, namely bits 18, 17, and 16. This makes up the 7 bit
+ * address sent on the I2C bus with bit 0 being the direction bit,
+ * which is not represented here, and sent by the hardware directly.
+ *
+ * For instance,
+ *   50h = 1010000b => device type identifier 1010b, bits 18:16 = 000b, address 0.
+ *   54h = 1010100b => --"--, bits 18:16 = 100b, address 40000h.
+ *   56h = 1010110b => --"--, bits 18:16 = 110b, address 60000h.
+ * Depending on the size of the I2C EEPROM device(s), bits 18:16 may
+ * address memory in a device or a device on the I2C bus, depending on
+ * the status of pins 1-3. See top of amdgpu_eeprom.c.
