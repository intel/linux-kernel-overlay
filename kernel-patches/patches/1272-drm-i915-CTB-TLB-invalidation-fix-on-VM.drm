Subject: [PATCH 1272/1274] drm/i915: CTB TLB invalidation fix on VM

port over delta changes between existing patches with
latest patches https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/series/125245/

The GuC firmware had defined the interface for Translation Look-Aside
Buffer (TLB) invalidation.  We should use this interface when
invalidating the engine and GuC TLBs.
Add additional functionality to intel_gt_invalidate_tlb, invalidating
the GuC TLBs and falling back to GT invalidation when the GuC is
disabled.
The invalidation is done by sending a request directly to the GuC
tlb_lookup that invalidates the table.  The invalidation is submitted as
a wait request and is performed in the CT event handler.  This means we
cannot perform this TLB invalidation path if the CT is not enabled.
If the request isn't fulfilled in two seconds, this would constitute
an error in the invalidation as that would constitute either a lost
request or a severe GuC overload.

With this new invalidation routine, we can perform GuC-based GGTT
invalidations.  GuC-based GGTT invalidation is incompatible with
MMIO invalidation so we should not perform MMIO invalidation when
GuC-based GGTT invalidation is expected.

The additional complexity incurred in this patch will be necessary for
range-based tlb invalidations, which will be platformed in the future.
