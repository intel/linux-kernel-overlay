Subject: [PATCH 0184/1714] drm/panel: st7703: Make jh057n00900_panel_desc
 static
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This eliminates the following sparse warning:

drivers/gpu/drm/panel/panel-sitronix-st7703.c:156:26: warning: symbol
'jh057n00900_panel_desc' was not declared. Should it be static?
