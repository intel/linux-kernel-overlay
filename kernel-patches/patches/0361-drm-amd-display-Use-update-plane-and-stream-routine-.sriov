Subject: [PATCH 0361/2236] drm/amd/display: Use update plane and stream
 routine for DCN32x

Sub-viewport (Subvp) feature is used for changing MCLK without causing
any display artifact, requiring special treatment from the plane and
stream perspective since DC needs to read data from the cache when using
subvp. However, the function dc_commit_updates_for_stream does not
provide all the support needed by this feature which will make this
function legacy at some point. For this reason, this commit enables
dc_update_planes_and_stream for ASICs that support this feature but
preserves the old behavior for other ASICs. However,
dc_update_planes_and_stream should replace dc_commit_updates_for_stream
for all ASICs since it does most of the tasks executed by
dc_commit_updates_for_stream with other extra operations, but we need to
run tests before making this change.
