Subject: [PATCH 268/333] lockdep: Swap storage for pin_count and references

As a lockmap takes a reference for every ww_mutex used together, this
can be an arbitrarily large number and under control of userspace --
easily overflowing the arbitrary limit of 4096. However, the pin_count
(used for detecting unexpected lock dropping) is a full 32b despite
nesting being extremely rare (see lockdep_pin_lock).
