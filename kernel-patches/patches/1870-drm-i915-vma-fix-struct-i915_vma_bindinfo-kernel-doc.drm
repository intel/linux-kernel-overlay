Subject: [PATCH 1870/2351] drm/i915/vma: fix struct i915_vma_bindinfo
 kernel-doc

You can't document both a sub-struct type and a struct member at the
same time. Separate them.

drivers/gpu/drm/i915/i915_vma_resource.h:91: warning: Incorrect use of kernel-doc format:          * struct i915_vma_bindinfo - Information needed for async bind
drivers/gpu/drm/i915/i915_vma_resource.h:129: warning: Function parameter or member 'bi' not described in 'i915_vma_resource'
