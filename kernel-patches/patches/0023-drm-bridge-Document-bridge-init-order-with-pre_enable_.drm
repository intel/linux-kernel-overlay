Subject: [PATCH 0023/1274] drm/bridge: Document bridge init order with
 pre_enable_prev_first
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

In order to satisfy the MIPI DSI initialization sequence the bridge
init order has been altered with the help of pre_enable_prev_first
in pre_enable and post_disable bridge operations.

Document the affectedÂ bridge init order with an example on the
bridge operations helpers.
