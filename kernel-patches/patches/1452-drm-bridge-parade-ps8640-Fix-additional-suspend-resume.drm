Subject: [PATCH 1452/2399] drm/bridge: parade-ps8640: Fix additional
 suspend/resume at bootup

Through log and waveform, we can see that there will be additional
suspend/resume when booting. This timing does not meet the ps8640 spec.
It seems that the delay of 500ms does not satisfied drm_panel_get_modes.
I increased it to 900ms and it seems that this problem can be solved.
To be safe, I'd just round up to a full 1000.
