Subject: [PATCH 0417/1274] drm/i915/cdclk: Document CDCLK components
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Improve documentation by giving an overview of the components involved
in the generation of the CDCLK.

v2: Fix htmldoc error because of missing blank line at the start of
    bulleted list.

  * DMC will not change the active CDCLK frequency however, so that part
  * will still be performed by the driver directly.
  *
+ * There are multiple components involved in the generation of the CDCLK
+ * frequency:
+ *
+ * - We have the CDCLK PLL, which generates an output clock based on a
+ *   reference clock and a ratio parameter.
+ * - The CD2X Divider, which divides the output of the PLL based on a
+ *   divisor selected from a set of pre-defined choices.
+ * - The CD2X Squasher, which further divides the output based on a
+ *   waveform represented as a sequence of bits where each zero
+ *   "squashes out" a clock cycle.
+ * - And, finally, a fixed divider that divides the output frequency by 2.
+ *
+ * As such, the resulting CDCLK frequency can be calculated with the
+ * following formula:
+ *
+ *     cdclk = vco / cd2x_div / (sq_len / sq_div) / 2
+ *
+ * , where vco is the frequency generated by the PLL; cd2x_div
+ * represents the CD2X Divider; sq_len and sq_div are the bit length
+ * and the number of high bits for the CD2X Squasher waveform, respectively;
+ * and 2 represents the fixed divider.
+ *
+ * Note that some older platforms do not contain the CD2X Divider
+ * and/or CD2X Squasher, in which case we can ignore their respective
+ * factors in the formula above.
+ *
  * Several methods exist to change the CDCLK frequency, which ones are
  * supported depends on the platform:
