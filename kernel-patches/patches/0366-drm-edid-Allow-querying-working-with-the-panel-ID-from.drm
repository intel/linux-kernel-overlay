Subject: [PATCH 0366/2399] drm/edid: Allow querying/working with the panel ID
 from the EDID

EDIDs have 32-bits worth of data which is intended to be used to
uniquely identify the make/model of a panel. This has historically
been used only internally in the EDID processing code to identify
quirks with panels.

We'd like to use this panel ID in panel drivers to identify which
panel is hooked up and from that information figure out power sequence
timings. Let's expose this information from the EDID code and also
allow it to be accessed early, before a connector has been created.

To make matching in the panel drivers code easier, we'll return the
panel ID as a 32-bit value. We'll provide some functions for
converting this value back and forth to something more human readable.

+ * that the EDID is valid) extracts the ID out of it. The ID is a 32-bit value
+ * (16 bits of manufacturer ID and 16 bits of per-manufacturer ID) that's
+ * supposed to be different for each different modem of panel.
+ *
+ * This function is intended to be used during early probing on devices where

+ * assume that the EDID of the panel is correct, at least as far as the ID
+ * is concerned (in other words, we don't process any overrides here).
+ *
+ * NOTE: it's expected that this function and drm_do_get_edid() will both
+ * be read the EDID, but there is no caching between them. Since we're only
+ * reading the first block, hopefully this extra overhead won't be too big.
