Subject: [PATCH 101/319] drm/i915/display: pre-initialize some values in
 probe_gmdid_display()
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

When intel_display_device_probe() (and, subsequently,
probe_gmdid_display()) returns, the caller expects ver, rel and step
to be initialized.  Since there's no way to check that there was a
failure and no_display was returned without some further refactoring,
pre-initiliaze all these values to zero to keep it simple and safe.
