Subject: [PATCH 1174/2236] drm/vc4: crtc: Increase setup cost in core clock
 calculation to handle extreme reduced blanking

The formula that determines the core clock requirement based on pixel
clock and blanking has been determined experimentally to minimise the
clock while supporting all modes we've seen.

A new reduced blanking mode (4kp60 at 533MHz rather than the standard
594MHz) has been seen that doesn't produce a high enough clock and
results in "flip_done timed out" error.

Increase the setup cost in the formula to make this work. The result is
a reduced blanking mode increases by up to 7MHz while leaving the
standard timing
mode untouched
