Subject: [PATCH 1030/2399] drm/i915: mark up internal objects with
 start_cpu_write
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

While the pages can't be swapped out, they can be discarded by the shrinker.
Normally such objects are marked with __I915_MADV_PURGED, which can't be
unset, and therefore requires a new object. For kernel internal objects
this is not true, since the madv hint is reset for our special volatile
objects, such that we can re-acquire new pages, if so desired, without
needing a new object. As a result we should probably be paranoid here
and put the object back into the CPU domain when discarding the pages,
and also correctly set cache_dirty, if required.
