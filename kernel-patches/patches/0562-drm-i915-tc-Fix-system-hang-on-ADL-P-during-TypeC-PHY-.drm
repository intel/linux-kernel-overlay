Subject: [PATCH 0562/2399] drm/i915/tc: Fix system hang on ADL-P during TypeC
 PHY disconnect
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

The PHY ownership release->AUX PW disable steps during a modeset
disable->PHY disconnect sequence can hang the system if the PHY
disconnect happens after disabling the PHY's PLL. The spec doesn't
require a specific order for these two steps, so this issue is still
being root caused by HW/FW teams. Until that is found, let's make
sure the disconnect happens before the PLL is disabled, and do this on
all platforms for consistency.

v2: Add a TODO comment to remove the w/a once the issue is root
    caused/fixed. (Jose)
