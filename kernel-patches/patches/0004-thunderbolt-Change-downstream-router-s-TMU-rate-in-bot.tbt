Subject: [PATCH 04/24] thunderbolt: Change downstream router's TMU rate in
 both TMU uni/bidir mode

In case of uni-directional time sync, TMU handshake is
initiated by upstream router. In case of bi-directional
time sync, TMU handshake is initiated by downstream router.
In order to handle correctly the case of uni-directional mode,
we avoid changing the upstream router's rate to off,
because it might have another downstream router plugged that is set to
uni-directional mode (and we don't want to change its mode).
Instead, we always change downstream router's rate.
