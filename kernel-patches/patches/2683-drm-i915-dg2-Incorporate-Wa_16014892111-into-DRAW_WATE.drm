Subject: [PATCH 2683/2871] drm/i915/dg2: Incorporate Wa_16014892111 into
 DRAW_WATERMARK tuning

Although register tuning settings are generally implemented via the
workaround infrastructure, it turns out that the DRAW_WATERMARK register
is not properly saved/restored by hardware around power events (i.e.,
RC6 entry) so updates to the value cannot be applied in the usual
manner.  New workaround Wa_16014892111 informs us that any tuning
updates to this register must instead be applied via an INDIRECT_CTX
batch buffer.  This will ensure that the necessary value is re-applied
when a context begins running, even if an RC6 entry had wiped the
register back to hardware defaults since the last context ran.

Fixes: 6dc85721df74 ("drm/i915/dg2: Add additional tuning settings")
Closes: https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/intel/-/issues/6642
