Subject: [PATCH 2208/2251] drm/vmwgfx: Reserve fence slots on buffer objects
 in cotables
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

The buffer objects created by cotables were missing fence reservations.
They are created from vmw_validation_res_validate which makes them miss
the ttm_eu_reserve_buffers which is called from vmw_validation_bo_reserve.

Cotables are the only resources which create a buffer object in the
create callback so make sure the code also reserves the slots.
