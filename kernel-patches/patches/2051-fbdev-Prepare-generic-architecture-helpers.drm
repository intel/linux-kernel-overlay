Subject: [PATCH 2051/2351] fbdev: Prepare generic architecture helpers

Generic implementations of fb_pgprotect() and fb_is_primary_device()
have been in the source code for a long time. Prepare the header file
to make use of them.

Improve the code by using an inline function for fb_pgprotect()
and by removing include statements. The default mode set by
fb_pgprotect() is now writecombine, which is what most platforms
want.

Symbols are protected by preprocessor guards. Architectures that
provide a symbol need to define a preprocessor token of the same
name and value. Otherwise the header file will provide a generic
implementation. This pattern has been taken from <asm/io.h>.

v3:
	* include the correct header files
v2:
	*  use writecombine mappings by default (Arnd)
