Subject: [PATCH 257/704] fbdev/au1200fb: Use struct fb_info.screen_buffer

Use info->screen_buffer when reading and writing framebuffers in
system memory. It's the correct pointer for this address space.

The struct fb_info has a union to store the framebuffer memory. This can
either be info->screen_base if the framebuffer is stored in I/O memory,
or info->screen_buffer if the framebuffer is stored in system memory.

As the driver operates on the latter address space, it is wrong to use
.screen_base and .screen_buffer must be used instead. This also gets
rid of casting needed due to not using the correct data type.
