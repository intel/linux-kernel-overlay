Subject: [PATCH 0616/2236] drm/radeon: Replace one-element array with
 flexible-array member

One-element arrays are deprecated, and we are replacing them with
flexible array members instead. So, replace one-element array with
flexible-array member in struct _ATOM_FAKE_EDID_PATCH_RECORD and
refactor the rest of the code accordingly.

It's worth mentioning that doing a build before/after this patch results
in no binary output differences.

This helps with the ongoing efforts to tighten the FORTIFY_SOURCE
routines on memcpy() and help us make progress towards globally
enabling -fstrict-flex-arrays=3 [1].
