Subject: [PATCH 0469/2399] drm/i915/selftests: exercise shmem_writeback with
 THP

In commit:

commit 1e6decf30af5c5c75445ed6ad4e65a26de578a03
Author: Hugh Dickins <hughd@google.com>

    shmem: shmem_writepage() split unlikely i915 THP

it looks THP + shmem_writeback was an unexpected combination, and ends up
hitting some BUG_ON, but it also looks like that is now fixed.

While the IGTs did eventually hit this(although not during pre-merge it
seems), it's likely worthwhile adding some explicit coverage for this
scenario in the shrink_thp selftest.
