Subject: [PATCH 1191/2251] drm/bridge: Clear the DP_AUX_I2C_MOT bit passed in
 aux read command.

If the previous transfer didn't end with a command without DP_AUX_I2C_MOT,
the next read trasnfer will miss the first byte. But if the command in
previous transfer is requested with length 0, it's a no-op to anx7625
since it can't process this command. anx7625 requires the last command
to be read command with length > 0.

It's observed that if we clear the DP_AUX_I2C_MOT in read transfer, we
can still get correct data. Clear the read commands with DP_AUX_I2C_MOT
bit to fix this issue.
