Subject: [PATCH 1889/2251] dma-resv: some doc polish for iterators
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Hammer it a bit more in that iterators can be restarted and when that
matters, plus suggest to prefer the locked version whenver.

Also delete the two leftover kerneldoc for static functions plus
sprinkle some more links while at it.

v2: Keep some comments (Christian)
