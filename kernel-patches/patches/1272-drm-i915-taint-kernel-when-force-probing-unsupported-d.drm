Subject: [PATCH 1272/2071] drm/i915: taint kernel when force probing
 unsupported devices

For development and testing purposes, the i915.force_probe module
parameter and DRM_I915_FORCE_PROBE kconfig option allow probing of
devices that aren't supported by the driver.

The i915.force_probe module parameter is "unsafe" and setting it taints
the kernel. However, using the kconfig option does not.

Always taint the kernel when force probing a device that is not
supported.

v2: Drop "depends on EXPERT" to avoid build breakage (kernel test robot)
