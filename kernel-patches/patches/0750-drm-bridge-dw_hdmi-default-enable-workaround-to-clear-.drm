Subject: [PATCH 750/877] drm: bridge: dw_hdmi: default enable workaround to
 clear the overflow

i.MX8MPlus (v2.13a) has verified need the workaround to clear the
overflow with one iteration.
Only i.MX6Q(v1.30a) need the workaround with 4 iterations,
the others versions later than v1.3a have been identified as needing
the workaround with a single iteration.

Default enable the workaround with one iteration for all versions
later than v1.30a.
