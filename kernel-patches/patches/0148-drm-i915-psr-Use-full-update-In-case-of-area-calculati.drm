Subject: [PATCH 0148/2779] drm/i915/psr: Use full update In case of area
 calculation fails
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Currently we have some corner cases where area calculation fails.  For
these sel fetch area calculation ends up having update area as y1 = 0,
y2 = 4. Instead of these values safer option is full update.

One of such for example is big fb with offset. We don't have usable
offset in psr2_sel_fetch_update. Currently it's open what is the
proper way to fix this corner case. Use full update for now.

v2: Commit message modified
v3: Print out debug info once when area calculation fails
v4: Use drm_info_once
v5: pipeA -> "pipe %c", pipe_name(crtc-pipe)
