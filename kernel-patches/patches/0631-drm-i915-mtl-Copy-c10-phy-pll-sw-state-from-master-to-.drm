Subject: [PATCH 631/704] drm/i915/mtl: Copy c10 phy pll sw state from master
 to slave for bigjoiner

We try to verify pll registers in sw state for slave crtc with the hw state.
However in case of bigjoiner we don't calculate those at all, so this verification
will then always fail.
So we should either skip the verification for Bigjoiner slave crtc or copy sw state
from master crtc.
