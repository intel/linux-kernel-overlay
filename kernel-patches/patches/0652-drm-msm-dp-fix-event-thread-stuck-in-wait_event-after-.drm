Subject: [PATCH 0652/2871] drm/msm/dp: fix event thread stuck in wait_event
 after kthread_stop()

Event thread supposed to exit from its while loop after kthread_stop().
However there may has possibility that event thread is pending in the
middle of wait_event due to condition checking never become true.
To make sure event thread exit its loop after kthread_stop(), this
patch OR kthread_should_stop() into wait_event's condition checking
so that event thread will exit its loop after kernal_stop().

Changes in v2:
--  correct spelling error at commit title

Changes in v3:
-- remove unnecessary parenthesis
-- while(1) to replace while (!kthread_should_stop())
