Subject: [PATCH 0284/2871] drm/rockchip: cdn-dp: change rk3399_cdn_dp from
 global to static

Smatch reports this issue
cdn-dp-core.c:51:20: warning: symbol 'rk3399_cdn_dp' was not declared. Should it be static?

rk3399_cdn_dp is only used in cdn-dp-core.c so change
its storge-class specifier to static.
