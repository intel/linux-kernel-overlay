Subject: [PATCH 0997/2779] drm/msm: Stop using iommu_present()

Even if some IOMMU has registered itself on the platform "bus", that
doesn't necessarily mean it provides translation for the device we
care about. Replace iommu_present() with a more appropriate check.

On Qualcomm platforms the IOMMU can be specified either for the MDP/DPU
device or for its parent MDSS device depending on the actual platform.
Check both of them, since that is how both DPU and MDP5 drivers work.
