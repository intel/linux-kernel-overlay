Subject: [PATCH 0657/1274] drm: Document requirements for driver-specific KMS
 props in new drivers

When extending support for a driver-specific KMS property to additional
drivers, we should apply all the requirements for new properties and
make sure the semantics are the same and documented.

v2: devs of the driver which introduced property shall help and ack

+For historical reasons, non-standard, driver-specific properties exist. If a KMS
+driver wants to add support for one of those properties, the requirements for
+new properties apply where possible. Additionally, the documented behavior must
+match the de facto semantics of the existing property to ensure compatibility.
+Developers of the driver that first added the property should help with those
