Subject: [PATCH 169/330] drm/lima: fix reference leak in lima_pm_busy

pm_runtime_get_sync will increment pm usage counter even it
failed. Forgetting to putting operation will result in a
reference leak here.

A new function pm_runtime_resume_and_get is introduced in
[0] to keep usage counter balanced. So We fix the reference
leak by replacing it with new function.

[0] commit dd8088d5a896 ("PM: runtime: Add  pm_runtime_resume_and_get to deal with usage counter")

Fixes: 50de2e9ebbc0 ("drm/lima: enable runtime pm")
