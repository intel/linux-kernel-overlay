Subject: [PATCH 0168/2351] drm/msm/dsi: Use DSC slice(s) packet size to
 compute word count

According to downstream the value to use for WORD_COUNT is
bytes_per_pkt, which denotes the number of bytes in a packet based on
how many slices have been configured by the panel driver times the
width of a slice times the number of bytes per pixel.

The DSC panels seen thus far use one byte per pixel, only one slice
per packet, and a slice width of half the panel width leading to the
desired bytes_per_pkt+1 value to be equal to hdisplay/2+1.  This however
isn't the case anymore for panels that configure two slices per packet,
where the value should now be hdisplay+1.

Note that the aforementioned panel (on a Sony Xperia XZ3, sdm845) with
slice_count=1 has also been tested to successfully accept slice_count=2,
which would have shown corrupted output previously.
