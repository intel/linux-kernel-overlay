Subject: [PATCH 1126/1423] drm/plane: Move drm_plane_enable_fb_damage_clips
 into core
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

We're trying to have a fairly strict split between core functionality
that defines the uapi, including the docs, and the helper functions to
implement it.

Move drm_plane_enable_fb_damage_clips and associated kerneldoc into
drm_plane from drm_damage_helper.c to fix this.

-/**
- * DOC: overview
- *
- * FB_DAMAGE_CLIPS is an optional plane property which provides a means to
- * specify a list of damage rectangles on a plane in framebuffer coordinates of
- * the framebuffer attached to the plane. In current context damage is the area
- * of plane framebuffer that has changed since last plane update (also called
- * page-flip), irrespective of whether currently attached framebuffer is same as
- * framebuffer attached during last plane update or not.
- *
- * FB_DAMAGE_CLIPS is a hint to kernel which could be helpful for some drivers
- * to optimize internally especially for virtual devices where each framebuffer
- * change needs to be transmitted over network, usb, etc.
- *
- * Since FB_DAMAGE_CLIPS is a hint so it is an optional property. User-space can
- * ignore damage clips property and in that case driver will do a full plane
- * update. In case damage clips are provided then it is guaranteed that the area
- * inside damage clips will be updated to plane. For efficiency driver can do
- * full update or can update more than specified in damage clips. Since driver
- * is free to read more, user-space must always render the entire visible
- * framebuffer. Otherwise there can be corruptions. Also, if a user-space
- * provides damage clips which doesn't encompass the actual damage to
- * framebuffer (since last plane update) can result in incorrect rendering.
- *
- * FB_DAMAGE_CLIPS is a blob property with the layout of blob data is simply an
- * array of &drm_mode_rect. Unlike plane &drm_plane_state.src coordinates,
- * damage clips are not in 16.16 fixed point. Similar to plane src in
- * framebuffer, damage clips cannot be negative. In damage clip, x1/y1 are
- * inclusive and x2/y2 are exclusive. While kernel does not error for overlapped
- * damage clips, it is strongly discouraged.
- *
- * Drivers that are interested in damage interface for plane should enable
- * FB_DAMAGE_CLIPS property by calling drm_plane_enable_fb_damage_clips().
- * Drivers implementing damage can use drm_atomic_helper_damage_iter_init() and
- * drm_atomic_helper_damage_iter_next() helper iterator function to get damage
- * rectangles clipped to &drm_plane_state.src.
