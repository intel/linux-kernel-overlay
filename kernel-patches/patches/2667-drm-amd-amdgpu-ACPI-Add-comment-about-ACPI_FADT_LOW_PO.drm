Subject: [PATCH 2667/2871] drm: amd: amdgpu: ACPI: Add comment about
 ACPI_FADT_LOW_POWER_S0

According to the ACPI specification [1], the ACPI_FADT_LOW_POWER_S0
flag merely means that it is better to use low-power S0 idle on the
given platform than S3 (provided that the latter is supported) and it
doesn't preclude using either of them (which of them will be used
depends on the choices made by user space).

However, on some systems that flag is used to indicate whether or not
to enable special firmware mechanics allowing the system to save more
energy when suspended to idle.  If that flag is unset, doing so is
generally risky.

Accordingly, add a comment to explain the ACPI_FADT_LOW_POWER_S0 check
in amdgpu_acpi_is_s0ix_active(), the purpose of which is otherwise
somewhat unclear.
