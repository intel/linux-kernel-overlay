Subject: [PATCH 764/888] drm/i915/pxp: add PXP documentation

Now that all the pieces are in place we can add a description of how the
feature works. Also modify the comments in struct intel_pxp into
kerneldoc.

v2: improve doc (Rodrigo)

+/**
+ * DOC: PXP
+ *
+ * PXP (Protected Xe Path) is a feature available in Gen12 and newer platforms.
+ * It allows execution and flip to display of protected (i.e. encrypted)
+ * objects. The SW support is enabled via the CONFIG_DRM_I915_PXP kconfig.
+ *
+ * Objects can opt-in to PXP encryption at creation time via the
+ * I915_GEM_CREATE_EXT_PROTECTED_CONTENT create_ext flag. For objects to be
+ * correctly protected they must be used in conjunction with a context created
+ * with the I915_CONTEXT_PARAM_PROTECTED_CONTENT flag. See the documentation
+ * of those two uapi flags for details and restrictions.
+ *
+ * Protected objects are tied to a pxp session; currently we only support one
+ * session, which i915 manages and whose index is available in the uapi
+ * (I915_PROTECTED_CONTENT_DEFAULT_SESSION) for use in instructions targeting
+ * protected objects.
+ * The session is invalidated by the HW when certain events occur (e.g.
+ * suspend/resume). When this happens, all the objects that were used with the
+ * session are marked as invalid and all contexts marked as using protected
+ * content are banned. Any further attempt at using them in an execbuf call is
+ * rejected, while flips are converted to black frames.
+ *
+ * Some of the PXP setup operations are performed by the Management Engine,
+ * which is handled by the mei driver; communication between i915 and mei is
+ * performed via the mei_pxp component module.
