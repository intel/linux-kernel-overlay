Subject: [PATCH 64/85] soundwire: bus: add new manager callback to deal with
 peripheral enumeration
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

When a peripheral reports as ATTACHED, the manager may need to follow
a programming sequence, e.g. to assign DMA resources and/or assign a
command queue for that peripheral.

This patch adds an optional callback, which will be invoked every time
the peripheral attaches. This might be overkill in some scenarios, and
one could argue that this should be invoked only on the first
attachment. The bus does not however track this first attachment with
any existing state-mirroring variable, and using dev_num_sticky would
not work across suspend-resume cycles.
