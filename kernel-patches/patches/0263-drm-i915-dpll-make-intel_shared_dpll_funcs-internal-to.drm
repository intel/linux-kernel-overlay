Subject: [PATCH 0263/2251] drm/i915/dpll: make intel_shared_dpll_funcs
 internal to intel_dpll_mgr.c
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Move struct intel_shared_dpll_funcs to intel_dpll_mgr.c, as no other
place needs to have access to it. We also don't need to have kernel-doc
documentation for file internal structures, so drop them while at it.
