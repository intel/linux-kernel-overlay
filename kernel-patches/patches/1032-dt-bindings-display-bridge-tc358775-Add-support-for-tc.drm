Subject: [PATCH 1032/1274] dt-bindings: display: bridge: tc358775: Add support
 for tc358765

The tc358765 is similar to tc358775. The tc358765 just an earlier version
of the hardware, and it's pin and register compatible with tc358775 for
most part.

From the binding point of view the only difference is that the tc358765
does not have stdby-gpios.
