Subject: [PATCH 1067/2779] drm/i915: Bump GT idling delay to 2 jiffies

In monitoring a transcode pipeline that is latency sensitive (it waits
between submitting frames, and each frame requires work on rcs/vcs/vecs
engines), it is found that it took longer than a single jiffy for it to
sustain its workload. Allowing an extra jiffy headroom for the userspace
prevents us from prematurely parking and having to exit powersaving
immediately.
