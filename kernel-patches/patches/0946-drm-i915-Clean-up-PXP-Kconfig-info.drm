Subject: [PATCH 0946/2399] drm/i915: Clean up PXP Kconfig info.

During the review I focused on stop the using of the "+"
to reference the newer platforms, but I forgot that we are
in a process of making things more clear and differentiate
graphics and display versions. So, let me to clean up this
a bit. Also, we don't need any version mentioned in the
config menu entry, only in the help.
