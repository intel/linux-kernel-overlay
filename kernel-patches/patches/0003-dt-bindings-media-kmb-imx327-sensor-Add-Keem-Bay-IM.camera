Subject: [PATCH 03/42] dt-bindings: media: kmb-imx327-sensor: Add Keem Bay
 IMX327 sensor

The KeemBay imx327 sensor is a Sony CMOS active pixel digital image
sensor with an active array size of 1937H x 1097V. It is programmable
through I2C interface. The I2C address is fixed to 0x1a as per sensor
data sheet.  Image data is sent through MIPI CSI-2, which is configured
as 4 lanes at 222.75 Mbps.

+description: |-
+  The KeemBay imx327 sensor is a Sony CMOS active pixel digital image sensor
+  with an active array size of 1937H x 1097V. It is programmable through I2C
+  interface. The I2C client address is fixed to 0x1a as per sensor data sheet.
+  Image data is sent through MIPI CSI-2, which is configured as 4 lanes at 445.5
+  Mbps.
+
+  The sensor can also be probed as platform device and later on registered
+  to the I2C bus. Probing as platform device is used when different
+  sensors with the same I2C client address must be able to be attached to one
+  slot. They are probed with priority. Example slot with multiple sensors
+  attached
