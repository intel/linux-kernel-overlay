Subject: [PATCH 2492/2740] drm/i915: Fix incorrect assert about pending power
 domain async-put work

It's possible that an already dequeued put_async_work() will release the
reference (*) that was put asynchronously after the dequeue happened.
This leaves an async-put work pending, without any reference to release.
A subsequent async-put may trigger the

drm_WARN_ON(!queue_delayed_work(&power_domains->async_put_work));

warn due to async_put_work() still pending. To avoid the warn, cancel
the pending async_put_work() when releasing the reference at (*) above.
