Subject: [PATCH 0410/2251] drm/i915/selftests: Use less in contexts steal guc
 id test

Using more guc_ids in the stealing guc id test has no real benefit.
Tearing down lots of contexts all at the same time takes a bit of time
due to the H2G / G2H ping-pong with the GuC. On some slower platforms
this can cause timeous when flushing the test as the GT isn't idle when
this ping-pong is happening. Reduce the number of guc ids to speed up
the flushing of the test.
