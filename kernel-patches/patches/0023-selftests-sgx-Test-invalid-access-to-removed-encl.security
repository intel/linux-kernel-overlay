Subject: [PATCH 23/26] selftests/sgx: Test invalid access to removed enclave
 page

Removing a page from an initialized enclave involves three steps:
(1) the user requests changing the page type to SGX_PAGE_TYPE_TRIM
via the SGX_IOC_PAGE_MODT ioctl, (2) on success the ENCLU[EACCEPT]
instruction is run from within the enclave to accept the page removal,
(3) the user initiates the actual removal of the page via the
SGX_IOC_PAGE_REMOVE ioctl.

Test two possible invalid accesses during the page removal flow:
* Test the behavior when a request to remove the page by changing its
  type to SGX_PAGE_TYPE_TRIM completes successfully but instead of
  executing ENCLU[EACCEPT] from within the enclave the enclave attempts
  to read from the page. Even though the page is accessible from the
  page table entries its type is SGX_PAGE_TYPE_TRIM and thus not
  accessible according to SGX. The expected behavior is a page fault
  with the SGX flag set in the error code.
* Test the behavior when the page type is changed successfully and
  ENCLU[EACCEPT] was run from within the enclave. The final ioctl,
  SGX_IOC_PAGE_REMOVE, is omitted and replaced with an attempt to access
  the page. Even though the page is accessible from the page table
  entries its type is SGX_PAGE_TYPE_TRIM and thus not accessible
  according to SGX.  The expected behavior is a page fault with the
  SGX flag set in the error code.
