Subject: [PATCH 1775/2251] drm/i915: Use intel_panel_edid_fixed_mode() for
 sdvo
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Despite the name intel_panel_edid_fixed_mode() doesn't actually
look in the EDID. All it does is dig out the preferred mode from
the connector's probed_modes list. That is also what the SDVO
LVDS code is doing by hand. Let's just call
intel_panel_edid_fixed_mode().

The slight difference in behaviour is that the SDVO code currently
bails if it can't find the preferred mode, whereas
intel_panel_edid_fixed_mode() will fall back to just returning
the first mode from the probed_modes list. Can't imagine why
such an LVDS panel would even exist, and also why would you have
a panel and be expected to not use it? So I'm going to assume
this is a total non-issue.
