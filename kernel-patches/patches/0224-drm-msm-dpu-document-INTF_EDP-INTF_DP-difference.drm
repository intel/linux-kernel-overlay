Subject: [PATCH 0224/2871] drm/msm/dpu: document INTF_EDP/INTF_DP difference

Based on the discussions on the mailing list, document enum
dpu_intf_type and it's controversial fields: INTF_DP and INTF_EDP.

INTF_EDP is used for older eDP interface found on msm8x74/msm8x84
INTF_DP is used for both eDP and DP interfaces handled by the msm/dp
driver. The DPU driver does not make a difference between them.
