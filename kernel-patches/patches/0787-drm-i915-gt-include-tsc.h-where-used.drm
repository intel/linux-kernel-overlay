Subject: [PATCH 787/888] drm/i915/gt: include tsc.h where used
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

We are currently using tsc_khz as a fallback so add the right include.
For other architectures we may need to add a different fallback, but
this is not being used by dgfx so we may as well just paper it over.
