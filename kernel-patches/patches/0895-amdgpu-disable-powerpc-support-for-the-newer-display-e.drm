Subject: [PATCH 0895/2871] amdgpu: disable powerpc support for the newer
 display engine

The DRM_AMD_DC_DCN display engine support (Raven, Navi, and newer) has
not been building cleanly on powerpc and causes link errors due to
mixing hard- and soft-float object files:

  powerpc64-linux-ld: drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/dml/display_mode_lib.o uses hard float, drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/dcn31/dcn31_resource.o uses soft float
  powerpc64-linux-ld: failed to merge target specific data of file drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/dcn31/dcn31_resource.o
  [..]

and while patches are floating around, it's not exactly obvious what is
going on.

The problem bisects to commit 41b7a347bf14 ("powerpc: Book3S 64-bit
outline-only KASAN support") but that is probably more about changing
config variables than the fundamental cause.

Despite the bisection result, a more directly related commit seems to be
26f4712aedbd ("drm/amd/display: move FPU related code from dcn31 to
dml/dcn31 folder").  It's probably a combination of the two.

This has been going on since the merge window, without any final word.
So instead of blindly applying patches that may or may not be the right
thing, let's disable this for now.

As Michael Ellerman says:
 "IIUIC this code was never enabled on ppc before, so disabling it seems
  like a reasonable fix to get the build clean"

and once we have more actual feedback (and find any potential users) we
can always re-enable it with the patch that fixes the issues and
back-port as necessary.

Fixes: 41b7a347bf14 ("powerpc: Book3S 64-bit outline-only KASAN support")
Fixes: 26f4712aedbd ("drm/amd/display: move FPU related code from dcn31 to dml/dcn31 folder")
