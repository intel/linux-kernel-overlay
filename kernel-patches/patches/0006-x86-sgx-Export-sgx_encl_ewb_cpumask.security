Subject: [PATCH 06/31] x86/sgx: Export sgx_encl_ewb_cpumask()

Using sgx_encl_ewb_cpumask() to learn which CPUs might have executed
an enclave is useful to ensure that TLBs are cleared when changes are
made to enclave pages.

sgx_encl_ewb_cpumask() is used within the reclaimer when an enclave
page is evicted. The upcoming SGX2 support enables changes to be
made to enclave pages and will require TLBs to not refer to the
changed pages and thus will be needing sgx_encl_ewb_cpumask().

Relocate sgx_encl_ewb_cpumask() to be with the rest of the enclave
code in encl.c now that it is no longer unique to the reclaimer.

Take care to ensure that any future usage maintains the
current context requirement that ETRACK has been called first.
Expand the existing comments to highlight this while moving them
to a more prominent location before the function.

No functional change.

+/**
+ * sgx_encl_ewb_cpumask() - Query which CPUs might be accessing the enclave
+ * @encl: the enclave
+ *
+ * Some SGX functions require that no cached linear-to-physical address
+ * mappings are present before they can succeed. For example, ENCLS[EWB]
+ * copies a page from the enclave page cache to regular main memory but
+ * it fails if it cannot ensure that there are no cached
+ * linear-to-physical address mappings referring to the page.
+ *
+ * SGX hardware flushes all cached linear-to-physical mappings on a CPU
+ * when an enclave is exited via ENCLU[EEXIT] or an Asynchronous Enclave
+ * Exit (AEX). Exiting an enclave will thus ensure cached linear-to-physical
+ * address mappings are cleared but coordination with the tracking done within
+ * the SGX hardware is needed to support the SGX functions that depend on this
+ * cache clearing.
+ *
+ * When the ENCLS[ETRACK] function is issued on an enclave the hardware
+ * tracks threads operating inside the enclave at that time. The SGX
+ * hardware tracking require that all the identified threads must have
+ * exited the enclave in order to flush the mappings before a function such
+ * as ENCLS[EWB] will be permitted
+ *
+ * The following flow is used to support SGX functions that require that
+ * no cached linear-to-physical address mappings are present:
+ * 1) Execute ENCLS[ETRACK] to initiate hardware tracking.
+ * 2) Use this function (sgx_encl_ewb_cpumask()) to query which CPUs might be
+ *    accessing the enclave.
+ * 3) Send IPI to identified CPUs, kicking them out of the enclave and
+ *    thus flushing all locally cached linear-to-physical address mappings.
+ * 4) Execute SGX function.
+ *
+ * Context: It is required to call this function after ENCLS[ETRACK].
+ *          This will ensure that if any new mm appears (racing with
+ *          sgx_encl_mm_add()) then the new mm will enter into the
+ *          enclave with fresh linear-to-physical address mappings.
+ *
+ *          It is required that all IPIs are completed before a new
+ *          ENCLS[ETRACK] is issued so be sure to protect steps 1 to 3
+ *          of the above flow with the enclave's mutex.
+ *
+ * Return: cpumask of CPUs that might be accessing @encl
