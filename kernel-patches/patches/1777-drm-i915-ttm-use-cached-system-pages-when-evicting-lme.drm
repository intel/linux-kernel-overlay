Subject: [PATCH 1777/2399] drm/i915/ttm: use cached system pages when evicting
 lmem
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This should let us do an accelerated copy directly to the shmem pages
when temporarily moving lmem-only objects, where the i915-gem shrinker
can later kick in to swap out the pages, if needed.
