Subject: [PATCH 538/888] drm/i915: Get proper min cdclk if vDSC enabled

VDSC engine can process only 1 pixel per Cd clock. In case
VDSC is used and max slice count == 1, max supported pixel
clock should be 100% of CD clock. Then do min_cdclk and
pixel clock comparison to get proper min cdclk.

v2:
- Check for dsc enable and slice count ==1 then allow to
  double confirm min cdclk value.
