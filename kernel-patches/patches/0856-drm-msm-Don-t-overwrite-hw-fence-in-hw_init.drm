Subject: [PATCH 0856/2871] drm/msm: Don't overwrite hw fence in hw_init

Prior to the last commit, this could result in setting the GPU
written fence value back to an older value, if we had missed
updating completed_fence prior to suspend.  This was mostly
harmless as the GPU would eventually overwrite it again with
the correct value.  But we should just not do this.  Instead
just leave a sanity check that the fence looks plausible (in
case the GPU scribbled on memory).
