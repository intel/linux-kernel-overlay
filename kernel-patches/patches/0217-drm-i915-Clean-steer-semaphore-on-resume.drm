Subject: [PATCH 217/333] drm/i915: Clean steer semaphore on resume

During resume, the steer semaphore on GT1 was observed to be held. The
hardware team has confirmed the safety of clearing steer semaphores
for all GTs during driver load/resume, as no lock acquisitions can occur
in this process by other agents.

v2: reset on resume not in intel_gt_init().
v3: do the reset on intel_gt_resume_early()
v4: do general sanitization for all GTs(Matt)
