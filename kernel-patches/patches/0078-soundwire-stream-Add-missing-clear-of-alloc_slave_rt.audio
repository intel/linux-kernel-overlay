Subject: [PATCH 78/85] soundwire: stream: Add missing clear of alloc_slave_rt

The current path that skips allocating the slave runtime does not clear
the alloc_slave_rt flag, this is clearly incorrect. Add the missing
clear, so the runtime won't be erroneously cleaned up.

Fixes: f3016b891c8c ("soundwire: stream: sdw_stream_add_ functions can be called multiple times")
