Subject: [PATCH 2633/2779] drm/i915/display: remove ipc_enabled from struct
 drm_i915_private
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

The ipc_enabled member was supposed to be moved under the display wm
sub-struct, but due to a rebase fail only the new one was added and the
old one was left behind. Finish the job.
