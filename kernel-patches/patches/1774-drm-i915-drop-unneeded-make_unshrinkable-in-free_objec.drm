Subject: [PATCH 1774/2399] drm/i915: drop unneeded make_unshrinkable in
 free_object
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

The comment here is no longer accurate, since the current shrinker code
requires a full ref before touching any objects. Also unset_pages()
should already do the required make_unshrinkable() for us, if needed,
which is also nicely balanced with set_pages().
