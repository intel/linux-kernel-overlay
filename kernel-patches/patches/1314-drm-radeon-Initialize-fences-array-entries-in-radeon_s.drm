Subject: [PATCH 1314/2871] drm/radeon: Initialize fences array entries in
 radeon_sa_bo_next_hole

Similar to the handling of amdgpu_sa_bo_next_hole in commit 6a15f3ff19a8
("drm/amdgpu: Initialize fences array entries in amdgpu_sa_bo_next_hole"),
we thought a patch might be needed here as well.

The entries were only initialized once in radeon_sa_bo_new. If a fence
wasn't signalled yet in the first radeon_sa_bo_next_hole call, but then
got signalled before a later radeon_sa_bo_next_hole call, it could
destroy the fence but leave its pointer in the array, resulting in
use-after-free in radeon_sa_bo_new.
