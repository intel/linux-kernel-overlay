Subject: [PATCH 232/704] drm/bridge: tc358768: always enable HS video mode

Always enable HS video mode setting the TXMD bit, without this change no
video output is present with DSI sinks that are setting
MIPI_DSI_MODE_LPM flag (tested with LT8912B DSI-HDMI bridge).

Previously the driver was enabling HS mode only when the DSI sink was
not explicitly setting the MIPI_DSI_MODE_LPM, however this is not
correct.

The MIPI_DSI_MODE_LPM is supposed to indicate that the sink is willing
to receive data in low power mode, however clearing the
TC358768_DSI_CONTROL_TXMD bit will make the TC358768 send video in
LP mode that is not the intended behavior.
