Subject: [PATCH 487/800] dt-bindings: msm/dp: mark vdda supplies as deprecated

The commit 85936d4f3815 ("phy: qcom-qmp: add regulator_set_load to dp
phy") moved setting regulator load to the DP PHY driver (QMP). Then, the
commit 7516351bebc1 ("drm/msm/dp: delete vdda regulator related
functions from eDP/DP controller") removed support for VDDA supplies
from the DP controller driver.
Mark these properties as deprecated and drop them from the example.
