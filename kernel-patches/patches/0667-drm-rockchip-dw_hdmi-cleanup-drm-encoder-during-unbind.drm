Subject: [PATCH 0667/2071] drm/rockchip: dw_hdmi: cleanup drm encoder during
 unbind

This fixes a use-after-free crash during rmmod.

The DRM encoder is embedded inside the larger rockchip_hdmi,
which is allocated with the component. The component memory
gets freed before the main drm device is destroyed. Fix it
by running encoder cleanup before tearing down its container.

[moved encoder cleanup above clk_disable, similar to bind-error-path]
