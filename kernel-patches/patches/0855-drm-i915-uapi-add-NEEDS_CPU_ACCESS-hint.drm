Subject: [PATCH 0855/2779] drm/i915/uapi: add NEEDS_CPU_ACCESS hint
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

If set, force the allocation to be placed in the mappable portion of
I915_MEMORY_CLASS_DEVICE. One big restriction here is that system memory
(i.e I915_MEMORY_CLASS_SYSTEM) must be given as a potential placement for the
object, that way we can always spill the object into system memory if we
can't make space.

Testcase: igt@gem-create@create-ext-cpu-access-sanity-check
