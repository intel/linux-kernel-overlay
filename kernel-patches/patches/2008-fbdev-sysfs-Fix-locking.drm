Subject: [PATCH 2008/2251] fbdev/sysfs: Fix locking

fb_set_var requires we hold the fb_info lock. Or at least this now
matches what the ioctl does ...

Note that ps3fb and sh_mobile_lcdcfb are busted in different ways here,
but I will not fix them up.

Also in practice this isn't a big deal, because really variable fbdev
state is actually protected by console_lock (because fbcon just
doesn't bother with lock_fb_info() at all), and lock_fb_info
protecting anything is really just a neat lie. But that's a much
bigger fish to fry.
