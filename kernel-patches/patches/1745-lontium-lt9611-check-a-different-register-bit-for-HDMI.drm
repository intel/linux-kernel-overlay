Subject: [PATCH 1745/2399] lontium-lt9611: check a different register bit for
 HDMI sensing

It has been observed that with certain monitors such as the HP Z27n,
the register 0x825e reads a value of 0x79 when the HDMI cable is
connected and 0x78 when it is disconnected, i.e. bit 0 appears
to correspond to the HDMI connection status and bit 2 is never
set. Therefore, change the driver to check bit 0 instead of bit 2.
