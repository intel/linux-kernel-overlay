Subject: [PATCH 1749/2399] dma-buf: make fence mandatory for
 dma_resv_add_excl_fence v2
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Calling dma_resv_add_excl_fence() with the fence as NULL and expecting
that that this frees up the fences is simply abuse of the internals of
the dma_resv object.

v2: drop the fence pruning completely.
