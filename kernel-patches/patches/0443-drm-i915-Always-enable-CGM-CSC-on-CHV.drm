Subject: [PATCH 443/704] drm/i915: Always enable CGM CSC on CHV
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

On CHV toggling the CGM CSC on/off while the pipe is running leads
to underruns. Looks like we'd have to do the toggling strictly inside
the start_of_vblank-frame_start window to avoid this, but that window
is less than a scanline so there's no way we can guarantee hitting it.

As a workaround let's just leave the CGM CSC permanently enabled.
Fortunately the CGM gamma/degamma units don't seem to suffer from
this malady.

I also tried turning off CGM unit clock gating, but that did not
help.
