Subject: [PATCH 277/319] drm/i915: refactor deprecated strncpy

`strncpy` is deprecated for use on NUL-terminated destination strings [1].

We should prefer more robust and less ambiguous string interfaces.

A suitable replacement is `strscpy` [2] due to the fact that it
guarantees NUL-termination on the destination buffer without
unnecessarily NUL-padding. `ctx` is zero allocated and as such strncpy's
NUL-padding behavior was strictly a performance hit which is now
resolved.
