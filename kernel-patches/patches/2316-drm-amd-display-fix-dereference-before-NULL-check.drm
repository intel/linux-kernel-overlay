Subject: [PATCH 2316/2399] drm/amd/display: fix dereference before NULL check
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

The "plane_state" pointer was access before checking if it was NULL.

Avoid a possible NULL pointer dereference by accessing the plane
address after the check.

Addresses-Coverity-ID: 1493892 ("Dereference before null check")
Fixes: 3f68c01be9a22 ("drm/amd/display: add cyan_skillfish display support")
