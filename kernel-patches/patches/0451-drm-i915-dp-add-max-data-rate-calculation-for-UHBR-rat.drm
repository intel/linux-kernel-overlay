Subject: [PATCH 451/888] drm/i915/dp: add max data rate calculation for UHBR
 rates

DP 2.0 UHBR link rates always use 128b/132b channel encoding, which has
a different data bandwidth efficiency from 8b/10b. The computation is
slightly convoluted due to the units we use; this is all explained in
the added comment.

v2: Clarified comment (Manasi)
