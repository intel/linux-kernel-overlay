Subject: [PATCH 0830/1423] drm/panel-simple: Update validation warnings for
 eDP panel description

Do not give a warning for the eDP panels if the "bus_format" is
not specified, since most eDP panels can support more than one
bus formats and this can be auto-detected.
Also, update the check to include bpc=10 for the eDP panel.
