Subject: [PATCH 1572/2871] drm: shmobile: Use backlight helper

This started with work on the removal of backlight_properties'
deprecated fb_blank field, much of which can be taken care of by using
helper functions provided by backlight.h instead of directly accessing
fields in backlight_properties. This patch series doesn't involve
fb_blank, but it still seems useful to use helper functions where
appropriate.

Instead of retrieving the backlight brightness in struct
backlight_properties manually, and then checking whether the backlight
should be on at all, use backlight_get_brightness() which does all
this and insulates this from future changes.
