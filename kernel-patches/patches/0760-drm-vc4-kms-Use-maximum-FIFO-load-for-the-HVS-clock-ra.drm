Subject: [PATCH 0760/2779] drm/vc4: kms: Use maximum FIFO load for the HVS
 clock rate

The core clock computation takes into account both the load due to the
input (ie, planes) and its output (ie, encoders).

However, while the input load needs to consider all the planes, and thus
sum all of their associated loads, the output happens mostly in
parallel.

Therefore, we need to consider only the maximum of all the output loads,
and not the sum like we were doing. This resulted in a clock rate way
too high which could be discarded for being too high by the clock
framework.

Since recent changes, the clock framework will even downright reject it,
leading to a core clock being too low for its current needs.

Fixes: 16e101051f32 ("drm/vc4: Increase the core clock based on HVS load")
