Subject: [PATCH 1522/2251] drm/bridge: Add myself as a reviewer for the Parade
 PS8640 bridge chip

Though the parade bridge chip is a little bit of a black box, I'm at
least interested in hearing about changes to the driver since this
bridge chip is used on some Chromebooks that I'm involved with.
