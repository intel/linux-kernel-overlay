Subject: [PATCH 0585/2251] drm/i915: Do not spam log with missing arch support
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Following what was done in drm_cache.c, when the stub for
remap_io_mapping() was added in commit 67c430bbaae1 ("drm/i915: Skip
remap_io_mapping() for non-x86 platforms"), it included a log message
with pr_err().  However just the warning is already enough and switching
to WARN_ONCE() allows us to keep the log message while avoiding log
spam.
