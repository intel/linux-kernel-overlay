Subject: [PATCH 102/163] KVM: TDX: Handle EXIT_REASON_OTHER_SMI with MSMI

When BIOS eMCA MCE-SMI morphing is enabled, the #MC is morphed to MSMI
(Machine Check System Management Interrupt).  Then the SMI causes TD exit
with the read reason of EXIT_REASON_OTHER_SMI with MSMI bit set in the exit
qualification to KVM instead of EXIT_REASON_EXCEPTION_NMI with MC
exception.

Handle EXIT_REASON_OTHER_SMI with MSMI bit set in the exit qualification as
MCE(Machine Check Exception) happened during TD guest running.
