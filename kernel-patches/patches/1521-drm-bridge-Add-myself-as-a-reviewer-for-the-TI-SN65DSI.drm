Subject: [PATCH 1521/2251] drm/bridge: Add myself as a reviewer for the TI
 SN65DSI86 bridge chip

I've spent quite a bit of time poking at this driver and it's used on
several Chromebooks I'm involved with. I'd like to get notified about
patches. Add myself as a reviewer. It's expected that changes will
still be landed through drm-misc as they always have been.
