Subject: [PATCH 22/26] selftests/sgx: Test faulty enclave behavior

Removing a page from an initialized enclave involves three steps:
first the user requests changing the page type to SGX_PAGE_TYPE_TRIM
via an ioctl, on success the ENCLU[EACCEPT] instruction needs to be run
from within the enclave to accept the page removal, finally the
user requests page removal to be completed via an ioctl. Only after
acceptance (ENCLU[EACCEPT]) from within the enclave can the kernel
remove the page from a running enclave.

Test the behavior when the user's request to change the page type
succeeds, but the ENCLU[EACCEPT] instruction is not run before the
ioctl requesting page removal is run. This should not be permitted.
