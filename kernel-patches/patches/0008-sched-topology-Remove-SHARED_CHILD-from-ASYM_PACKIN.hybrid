Subject: [PATCH 08/12] sched/topology: Remove SHARED_CHILD from ASYM_PACKING

Only x86 and Power7 use ASYM_PACKING. They use it differently.

Power7 has cores of equal priority, but the SMT siblings of a core have
different priorities. Parent scheduling domains do not need (nor have) the
ASYM_PACKING flag. SHARED_CHILD is not needed. Using SHARED_PARENT would
cause the topology debug code to complain.

X86 has cores of different priority, but all the SMT siblings of the core
have equal priority. It needs ASYM_PACKING at the MC level, but not at the
SMT level (it also needs it at upper levels if they have scheduling groups
of different priority). Removing ASYM_PACKING from the SMT domain causes
the topology debug code to complain.

Remove SHARED_CHILD for now. We still need a topology check that satisfies
both architectures.
