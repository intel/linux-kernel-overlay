Subject: [PATCH 1043/2740] drm: bridge/panel: Cleanup connector on bridge
 detach

If we don't call drm_connector_cleanup() manually in
panel_bridge_detach(), the connector will be cleaned up with the other
DRM objects in the call to drm_mode_config_cleanup(). However, since our
drm_connector is devm-allocated, by the time drm_mode_config_cleanup()
will be called, our connector will be long gone. Therefore, the
connector must be cleaned up when the bridge is detached to avoid
use-after-free conditions.

v2: Cleanup connector only if it was created

v3: Add FIXME

v4: (Use connector->dev) directly in if() block

Fixes: 13dfc0540a57 ("drm/bridge: Refactor out the panel wrapper from the lvds-encoder bridge.")
