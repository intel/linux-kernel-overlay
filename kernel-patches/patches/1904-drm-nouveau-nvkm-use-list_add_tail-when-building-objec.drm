Subject: [PATCH 1904/2871] drm/nouveau/nvkm: use list_add_tail() when building
 object tree

Fixes resume from hibernate failing on (at least) TU102, where cursor
channel init failed due to being performed before the core channel.

Not solid idea why suspend-to-ram worked, but, presumably HW being in
an entirely clean state has something to do with it.
