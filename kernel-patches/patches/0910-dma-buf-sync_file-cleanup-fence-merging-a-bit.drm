Subject: [PATCH 0910/2871] dma-buf/sync_file: cleanup fence merging a bit
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

krealloc_array() ignores attempts to reduce the array size, so the attempt
to save memory is completely pointless here.

Also move testing for the no fence case into sync_file_set_fence(), this
way we don't even touch the fence array when we don't have any fences.
