Subject: [PATCH 1911/2071] drm/i915/selftest: annotate maybe unused but set
 variable unused
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Prepare for re-enabling -Wunused-but-set-variable.

The variable is indeed 'unused' as the name suggests, but we can't just
drop it because i915_vma_unbind_unlocked() is annotated
__must_check. Apparently the selftest does not really need to check the
value.
