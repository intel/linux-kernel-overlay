Subject: [PATCH 10/26] x86/sgx: Keep record of SGX page type

SGX2 functions are not allowed on all page types. For example,
ENCLS[EMODPR] is only allowed on regular SGX enclave pages and
ENCLS[EMODPT] is only allowed on TCS and regular pages. If these
functions are attempted on another type of page the hardware would
trigger a fault.

Keep a record of the SGX page type so that there is more
certainty whether an SGX2 instruction can succeed and faults
can be treated as real failures.

The page type is made to be a property of struct sgx_encl_page
and thus does not cover the VA page type. VA pages are maintained
in separate structures and thus their type can be determined in
a different way. The SGX2 instructions being supported do not
operate on VA pages and this is thus not a scenario needing to
be covered at this time.

With the protection bits consuming 16 bits of the unsigned long
there is room available in the bitfield to include the page type
information without increasing the space consumed by the struct.
