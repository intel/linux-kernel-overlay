Subject: [PATCH 0539/2071] drm/bridge: adv7533: Fix adv7533_mode_valid for
 adv7533 and adv7535

When dynamically switching lanes was removed, the intent of the code
was to check to make sure that higher speed items used 4 lanes, but
it had the unintended consequence of removing the slower speeds for
4-lane users.

This attempts to remedy this by doing a check to see that the
max frequency doesn't exceed the chip limit, and a second
check to make sure that the max bit-rate doesn't exceed the
number of lanes * max bit rate / lane.
