Subject: [PATCH 2256/2871] drm/vc4: hdmi: Rework power up

The current code tries to handle the case where CONFIG_PM isn't selected
by first calling our runtime_resume implementation and then properly
report the power state to the runtime_pm core.

This allows to have a functionning device even if pm_runtime_get_*
functions are nops.

However, the device power state if CONFIG_PM is enabled is
RPM_SUSPENDED, and thus our vc4_hdmi_write() and vc4_hdmi_read() calls
in the runtime_pm hooks will now report a warning since the device might
not be properly powered.

Even more so, we need CONFIG_PM enabled since the previous RaspberryPi
have a power domain that needs to be powered up for the HDMI controller
to be usable.

The previous patch has created a dependency on CONFIG_PM, now we can
just assume it's there and only call pm_runtime_resume_and_get() to make
sure our device is powered in bind.
