Subject: [PATCH 8/9] drm/i915/gt: Restart the heartbeat timer when forcing a
 pulse

The context persistence code does things like send super high priority
heartbeat pulses to ensure any leaked context can still be pre-empted
and thus isn't a total denial of service but only a minor denial of
service. Unfortunately, it wasn't bothering to restart the heatbeat
worker with a fresh timeout. Thus, if a persistent context happened to
be closed just before the heartbeat was going to go ping anyway then
the forced pulse would get a negligble execution time. And as the
forced pulse is super high priority, the worker thread's next step is
a reset. Which means a potentially innocent system randomly goes boom
when attempting to close a context. So, force a re-schedule of the
worker thread with the appropriate timeout.
