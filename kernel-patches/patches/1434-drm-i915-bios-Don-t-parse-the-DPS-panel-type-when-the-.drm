Subject: [PATCH 1434/2871] drm/i915/bios: Don't parse the DPS panel type when
 the VBT does not have it
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Older VBTs don't have all the stuff we've defined for the
LVDS options block (40). In particular we're currently parsing
the DPS panel type bits even though they may not exist, which
could mean we end up flagging the machine as supporting static
DRRS when the VBT declared no such thing.

We don't actually have a clear idea which VBT versions have
which bits so we rely on the block size instead.

Here's a quick list from my VBT stash:
mgm version 108 -> 4 bytes
alv version 120 -> 4 bytes
cst version 134 -> 14 bytes
pnv version 144 -> 14 bytes
cl  version 142 -> 16 bytes
ctg version 155 -> 24 bytes
