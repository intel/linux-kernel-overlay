Subject: [PATCH 190/333] drm/i915/xe2lpd: Don't try to program PLANE_AUX_DIST

Since Xe2LPD technically has FlatCCS, it doesn't have AuxCCS registers
like PLANE_AUX_DIST.  However we currently have HAS_FLAT_CCS hardcoded
to 0 since compression isn't ready; we need to make sure this doesn't
cause the display code to go back to trying to write this register.
