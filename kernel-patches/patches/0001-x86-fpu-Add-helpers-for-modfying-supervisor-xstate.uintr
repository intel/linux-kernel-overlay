Subject: [PATCH 01/16] x86/fpu: Add helpers for modfying supervisor xstate

Add helpers that can be used to modify supervisor xstate safely for the
current task.

State for supervisors xstate based features can be live and
accesses via MSR's, or saved in memory in an xsave buffer. When the
kernel needs to modify this state it needs to be sure to operate on it
in the right place, so the modifications don't get clobbered.

In the past supervisor xstate features have used get_xsave_addr()
directly, and performed open coded logic to determine whether to operate
on the saved state or the MSR's directly. This has posed two problems:
 1. It has functionally been got wrong more than once.
 2. To reduce code, less common path's are not optimized. Determination
    of which path's are less common is based on assumptions about far away
    code that could change.

In addition, now that get_xsave_addr() is not available outside of the
core fpu code, there isn't even a way for these supervisor features to
modify the in memory state.

To resolve these problems, add some helpers that encapsulate the correct
logic to operate on the correct copy of the state. Map the MSR's to the
struct field location in a case statements in __get_xsave_member().

Use the helpers like this, to write to either the MSR or saves state:
void *xstate;

xstate = start_update_xsave_msrs(XFEATURE_FOO);
r = xsave_rdmsrl(state, MSR_IA32_FOO_1, &val)
if (r)
	xsave_wrmsrl(state, MSR_IA32_FOO_2, FOO_ENABLE);
end_update_xsave_msrs();
