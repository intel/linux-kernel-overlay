Subject: [PATCH 0140/2871] drm/msm/disp/dpu1: Add support for DSC in topology

For DSC to work we typically need a 2,2,1 configuration. This should
suffice for resolutions up to 4k. For more resolutions like 8k this won't
work.

Also, it is better to use 2 LMs and DSC instances as half width results
in lesser power consumption as compared to single LM, DSC at full width.

The panel has been tested only with 2,2,1 configuration, so for
now we blindly create 2,2,1 topology when DSC is enabled
