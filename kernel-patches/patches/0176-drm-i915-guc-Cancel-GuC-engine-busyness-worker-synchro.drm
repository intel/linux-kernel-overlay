Subject: [PATCH 176/800] drm/i915/guc: Cancel GuC engine busyness worker
 synchronously

The worker is canceled in gt_park path, but earlier it was assumed that
gt_park path cannot sleep and the cancel is asynchronous. This caused a
race with suspend flow where the worker runs after suspend and causes an
unclaimed register access warning. Cancel the worker synchronously since
the gt_park is indeed allowed to sleep.

v2: Fix author name and sign-off mismatch
