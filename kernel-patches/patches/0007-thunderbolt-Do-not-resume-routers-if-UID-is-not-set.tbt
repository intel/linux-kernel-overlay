Subject: [PATCH 07/25] thunderbolt: Do not resume routers if UID is not set

Routers might not have a UID set if the DROM read failed during
initialization previously.

Normally upon resume the UID is re-read to confirm it's the same
device connected.
* If the DROM read failed during init but then succeeded during
  resume it could either be a new device or faulty device
* If the DROM read failed during init and also failed during resume
  it might be a different device plugged in all together.

Detect this situation and prevent re-using the same configuration in
these cirucmstances.
