Subject: [PATCH 0469/1087] drm/i915/gt: Clear the execlists timers upon reset

Across a reset, we stop the engine but not the timers. This leaves a
window where the timers have inconsistent state with the engine, but
should only result in a spurious timeout. As we cancel the outstanding
events, also cancel their timers.
