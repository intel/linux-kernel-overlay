Subject: [PATCH 1270/2071] drm/i915: Fix NULL ptr deref by checking
 new_crtc_state

intel_atomic_get_new_crtc_state can return NULL, unless crtc state wasn't
obtained previously with intel_atomic_get_crtc_state, so we must check it
for NULLness here, just as in many other places, where we can't guarantee
that intel_atomic_get_crtc_state was called.
We are currently getting NULL ptr deref because of that, so this fix was
confirmed to help.
