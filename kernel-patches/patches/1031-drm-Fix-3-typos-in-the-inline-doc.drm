Subject: [PATCH 1031/2740] drm: Fix 3 typos in the inline doc

Fix the following typos:

1. When mentioning a list of functions, the function
drm_atomic_helper_disable_plane is mentioned twice.

2. drop the word 'afterwards':
s/afterwards after that/after that/'

3. drop extra 'the':
s/but do not the support the full/but do not support the full/
