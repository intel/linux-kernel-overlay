Subject: [PATCH 1115/1423] drm/i915/display/psr2: Mark as updated all planes
 that intersect with pipe_clip
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Without this planes that were added by intel_psr2_sel_fetch_update()
that intersect with pipe damaged area will not
have skl_program_plane() and intel_psr2_program_plane_sel_fetch()
called, causing panel to not be properly updated.
