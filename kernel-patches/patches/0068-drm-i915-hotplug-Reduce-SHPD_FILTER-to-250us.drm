Subject: [PATCH 068/319] drm/i915/hotplug: Reduce SHPD_FILTER to 250us

On TGP, the RTC (always running) was reduced from 3MHz to 32KHz.
As a result of this change, when HPD active going low pulse or HPD IRQ
is presented and the refclk (19.2MHz) is not toggling already toggling,
there is a 60 to 90us synchronization delay which effectively reduces
the duration of the IRQ pulse to less than the programmed 500us filter
value and the hot plug interrupt is NOT registered.
Solution was to Reduce SHPD_FILTER to 250us for ADL and above.
This solution was derived when the below patch was floated.

and after some internal discussion Ville's suggestion made sense.

Bspec: 68970
