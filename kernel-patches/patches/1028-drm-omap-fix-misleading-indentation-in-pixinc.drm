Subject: [PATCH 1028/2740] drm/omap: fix misleading indentation in pixinc()
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

An old patch added a 'return' statement after each BUG() in this driver,
which was necessary at the time, but has become redundant after the BUG()
definition was updated to handle this properly.

gcc-11 now warns about one such instance, where the 'return' statement
was incorrectly indented:

drivers/gpu/drm/omapdrm/dss/dispc.c: In function ‘pixinc’:
drivers/gpu/drm/omapdrm/dss/dispc.c:2093:9: error: this ‘else’ clause does not guard... [-Werror=misleading-indentation]
 2093 |         else
      |         ^~~~
drivers/gpu/drm/omapdrm/dss/dispc.c:2095:17: note: ...this statement, but the latter is misleadingly indented as if it were guarded by the ‘else’
 2095 |                 return 0;
      |                 ^~~~~~

Address this by removing the return again and changing the BUG()
to be unconditional to make this more intuitive.
