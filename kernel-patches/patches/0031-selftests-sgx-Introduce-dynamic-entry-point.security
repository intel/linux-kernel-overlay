Subject: [PATCH 31/38] selftests/sgx: Introduce dynamic entry point

The test enclave (test_encl.elf) is built with two initialized
Thread Control Structures (TCS) included in the binary. Both TCS are
initialized with the same entry point, encl_entry, that correctly
computes the absolute address of the stack based on the stack of each
TCS that is also built into the binary.

A new TCS can be added dynamically to the enclave and requires to be
initialized with an entry point used to enter the enclave. Since the
existing entry point, encl_entry, assumes that the TCS and its stack
exists at particular offsets within the binary it is not able to handle
a dynamically added TCS and its stack.

Introduce a new entry point, encl_dyn_entry, that initializes the absolute
address of that thread's stack to the address immediately preceding the
TCS itself. It is now possible to dynamically add a contiguous memory
region to the enclave with the new stack preceding the new TCS. With the
new TCS initialized with encl_dyn_entry as entry point the absolute address
of the stack is computed correctly on entry.
