Subject: [PATCH 0987/2251] drm/msm/dp: fix panel bridge attachment

In commit 8a3b4c17f863 ("drm/msm/dp: employ bridge mechanism for display
enable and disable") the DP driver received a drm_bridge instance, which
is always attached to the encoder as a root bridge. However it conflicts
with the panel_bridge support for eDP panels. The panel bridge attaches
to the encoder before the "dp" bridge (DP driver's drm_bridge instance
created in msm_dp_bridge_init()) has a chance to do so. Change
panel bridge attachment to come after the "dp" bridge attachment (and to
use it as a previous bridge).

Fixes: 8a3b4c17f863 ("drm/msm/dp: employ bridge mechanism for display enable and disable")
