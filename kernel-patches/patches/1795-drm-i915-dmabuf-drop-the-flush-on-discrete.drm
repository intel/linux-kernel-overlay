Subject: [PATCH 1795/2399] drm/i915/dmabuf: drop the flush on discrete
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

We were overzealous here; even though discrete is non-LLC, it should
still be always coherent.

v2(Thomas & Daniel)
  - Be extra cautious and limit to DG1
  - Add some more commentary
