+Enclave runtime management
+--------------------------
+
+Systems supporting SGX2 additionally support changes to initialized
+enclaves: modifying enclave page permissions and type, and dynamically
+adding and removing of enclave pages. When an enclave accesses an address
+within its address range that does not have a backing page then a new
+regular page will be dynamically added to the enclave. The enclave is
+still required to run EACCEPT on the new page before it can be used.
