Subject: [PATCH 1412/2251] drm/amdgpu: keep mmhub clock gating being enabled
 during s2idle suspend

Without MMHUB clock gating being enabled then MMHUB will not disconnect
from DF and will result in DF C-state entry can't be accessed during S2idle
suspend, and eventually s0ix entry will be blocked.
