Subject: [PATCH 0064/1087] drm: panel: simple: Fixup the struct panel_desc
 kernel doc

When I run:
  scripts/kernel-doc -rst drivers/gpu/drm/panel/panel-simple.c

I see that several of the kernel-doc entries aren't showing up because
they don't specify the full path down the hierarchy.  Let's fix that
and also move to inline kernel docs.
