Subject: [PATCH 1414/2251] drm/i915: Introduce new Tile 4 format

This tiling layout uses 4KB tiles in a row-major layout. It has the same
shape as Tile Y at two granularities: 4KB (128B x 32) and 64B (16B x 4). It
only differs from Tile Y at the 256B granularity in between. At this
granularity, Tile Y has a shape of 16B x 32 rows, but this tiling has a shape
of 64B x 8 rows.
