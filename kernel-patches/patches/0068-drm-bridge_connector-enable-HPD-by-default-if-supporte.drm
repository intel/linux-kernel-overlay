Subject: [PATCH 068/877] drm/bridge_connector: enable HPD by default if
 supported

Hotplug events reported by bridge drivers over drm_bridge_hpd_notify()
get ignored unless somebody calls drm_bridge_hpd_enable(). When the
connector for the bridge is bridge_connector, such a call is done from
drm_bridge_connector_enable_hpd().

However drm_bridge_connector_enable_hpd() is never called on init paths,
documentation suggests that it is intended for suspend/resume paths.

In result, once encoders are switched to bridge_connector,
bridge-detected HPD stops working.

This patch adds a call to that API on init path.

This fixes HDMI HPD with rcar-du + adv7513 case when adv7513 reports HPD
events via interrupts.

Fixes: c24110a8fd09 ("drm: rcar-du: Use drm_bridge_connector_init() helper")
