Subject: [PATCH 0264/2871] drm/msm/dp: Support the eDP modes given by panel

The eDP controller does not have a reliable way keep panel
powered on to read the sink capabilities. So, the controller
driver cannot validate if a mode can be supported by the
source. We will rely on the panel driver to populate only
the supported modes for now.
