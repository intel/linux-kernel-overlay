Subject: [PATCH 1975/2351] gpu: drm: bridge: No need to set device_driver
 owner

There is no need to exclusively set the .owner member of the struct
device_driver when defining the platform_driver struct. The Linux core
takes care of setting the .owner member as part of the call to
module_platform_driver() helper function.

Issue identified using the platform_no_drv_owner.cocci Coccinelle
semantic patch as:
drivers/gpu/drm/bridge/samsung-dsim.c:1957:6-11: No need to set .owner here.
The core will do it.

No functional changes are intended.
