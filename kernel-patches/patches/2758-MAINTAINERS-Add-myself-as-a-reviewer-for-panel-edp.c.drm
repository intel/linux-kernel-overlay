Subject: [PATCH 2758/2871] MAINTAINERS: Add myself as a reviewer for
 panel-edp.c

panel-edp changes go through the drm-misc tree (as per the "DRM PANEL
DRIVERS" entry in MAINTAINERS), but ever since splitting panel-edp out
of panel-simple I've been trying to keep a close eye on it. Make that
official by listing me as a reviewer.
