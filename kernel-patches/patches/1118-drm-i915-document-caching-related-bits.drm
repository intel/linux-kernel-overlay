Subject: [PATCH 1118/1423] drm/i915: document caching related bits
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Try to document the object caching related bits, like cache_coherent and
cache_dirty.

v2(Ville):
 - As pointed out by Ville, fix the completely incorrect assumptions
   about the "partial" coherency on shared LLC platforms.
v3(Daniel):
 - Fix nonsense about "dirtying" the cache with reads.
v4(Daniel):
 - Various improvements, including adding some more details for WT.

+	 * On platforms which don't have the shared LLC(HAS_SNOOP), like on Atom

+	 * GTT caching bits(see enum i915_cache_level). When enabling coherency

+	 * i.e @cache_coherent is zero.
+	 *
+	 * On platforms that share the LLC with the CPU(HAS_LLC), all GT memory
+	 * access will automatically snoop the CPU caches(even with CACHE_NONE).
+	 * The one exception is when dealing with the display engine, like with
+	 * scanout surfaces. To handle this the kernel will always flush the
+	 * surface out of the CPU caches when preparing it for scanout.  Also
+	 * note that since scanout surfaces are only ever read by the display
+	 * engine we only need to care about flushing any writes through the CPU
+	 * cache, reads on the other hand will always be coherent.
+	 *
+	 * Something strange here is why @cache_coherent is not a simple
+	 * boolean, i.e coherent vs non-coherent. The reasoning for this is back
+	 * to the display engine not being fully coherent. As a result scanout
+	 * surfaces will either be marked as I915_CACHE_NONE or I915_CACHE_WT.
+	 * In the case of seeing I915_CACHE_NONE the kernel makes the assumption
+	 * that this is likely a scanout surface, and will set @cache_coherent
+	 * as only I915_BO_CACHE_COHERENT_FOR_READ, on platforms with the shared
+	 * LLC. The kernel uses this to always flush writes through the CPU
+	 * cache as early as possible, where it can, in effect keeping
+	 * @cache_dirty clean, so we can potentially avoid stalling when
+	 * flushing the surface just before doing the scanout.  This does mean
+	 * we might unnecessarily flush non-scanout objects in some places, but
+	 * the default assumption is that all normal objects should be using
+	 * I915_CACHE_LLC, at least on platforms with the shared LLC.
+	 *
+	 * Supported values:
+	 *
+	 * I915_BO_CACHE_COHERENT_FOR_READ:
+	 *
+	 * On shared LLC platforms, we use this for special scanout surfaces,
+	 * where the display engine is not coherent with the CPU cache. As such
+	 * we need to ensure we flush any writes before doing the scanout. As an
+	 * optimisation we try to flush any writes as early as possible to avoid
+	 * stalling later.
+	 *
+	 * Thus for scanout surfaces using I915_CACHE_NONE, on shared LLC
+	 * platforms, we use:
+	 *
+	 *	cache_coherent = I915_BO_CACHE_COHERENT_FOR_READ
+	 *
+	 * While for normal objects that are fully coherent, including special
+	 * scanout surfaces marked as I915_CACHE_WT, we use:
+	 *
+	 *	cache_coherent = I915_BO_CACHE_COHERENT_FOR_READ |
+	 *			 I915_BO_CACHE_COHERENT_FOR_WRITE
+	 *
+	 * And then for objects that are not coherent at all we use:
+	 *
+	 *	cache_coherent = 0
+	 *
+	 * I915_BO_CACHE_COHERENT_FOR_WRITE:
+	 *
+	 * When writing through the CPU cache, the GPU is still coherent. Note
+	 * that this also implies I915_BO_CACHE_COHERENT_FOR_READ.
