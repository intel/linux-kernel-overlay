Subject: [PATCH 095/105] drm/sun4i: dw-hdmi: Fix max. frequency for H6

It turns out that reasoning for lowering max. supported frequency is
wrong. Scrambling works just fine. Several now fixed bugs prevented
proper functioning, even with rates lower than 340 MHz. Issues were just
more pronounced with higher frequencies.

Fix that by allowing max. supported frequency in HW and fix the comment.
