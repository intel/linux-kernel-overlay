Subject: [PATCH 2240/2251] drm/sun4i: Add support for D1 TCONs

D1 has a TCON TOP, so its quirks are similar to those for the R40 TCONs.
While there are some register changes, the part of the TCON TV supported
by the driver matches the R40 quirks, so that quirks structure can be
reused. D1 has the first supported TCON LCD with a TCON TOP, so the TCON
LCD needs a new quirks structure.

D1's TCON LCD hardware supports LVDS; in fact it provides dual-link LVDS
from a single TCON. However, it comes with a brand new LVDS PHY. Since
this PHY has not been tested, leave out LVDS driver support for now.
