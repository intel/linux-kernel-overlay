Subject: [PATCH 2868/2871] drm/i915: Set correct domains values at
 _i915_vma_move_to_active

Fix regression introduced by commit:
"drm/i915: Individualize fences before adding to dma_resv obj"
which sets obj->read_domains to 0 for both read and write paths.
Also set obj->write_domain to 0 on read path which was removed by
the commit.
