Subject: [PATCH 0739/2251] drm/i915: Flag crtc scaling_filter changes as
 modeset
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

The core doesn't flag scaling_filter prop changes as needing
a modeset. That doesn't work for us since we only reprogram the
pipe scaler during full modesets and fastsets. So we need to
flag the prop change as a modeset ourselves. Assuming nothing else
has changed the operation will get promoted (demoted?) to a fastset
later.
