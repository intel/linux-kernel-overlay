Subject: [PATCH 0858/2871] drm: panel-orientation-quirks: Add quirk for Aya
 Neo Next

The device is identified by "NEXT" in board name, however there are
different versions of it, "Next Advance" and "Next Pro", that have
different DMI board names.
Due to a production error a batch or two have their board names prefixed
by "AYANEO", this makes it 6 different DMI board names. To save some
space in final kernel image DMI_MATCH is used instead of
DMI_EXACT_MATCH.
