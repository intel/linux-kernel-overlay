-CI-only patches
-
-Some times patches need to be temporarily added to overcome regressions that
-can't be quickly fixed to unblock CI. Some times we also want to bring the real
-fix from other upstream branches before they propagate to Linus' master branch
-(or stable releases).
-
-This section is the equivalent of the topic/core-for-CI in upstream.
