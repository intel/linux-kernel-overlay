Subject: [PATCH 667/877] drm/fourcc: Introduce format modifiers for DG2 render
 and media compression

The render/media engines on DG2 unify render compression and media
compression into a single format for the first time, using the Tile 4
layout for main surfaces. The compression algorithm is different from
any previous platform and the display engine must still be configured to
decompress either a render or media compressed surface; as such, we
need new RC and MC framebuffer modifiers to represent buffers in this
format.

v2: Clarify modifier layout description.
