Subject: [PATCH 168/888] drm/bridge: ti-sn65dsi86: Avoid creating multiple
 connectors

If we created our own connector because the driver does not support the
NO_CONNECTOR flag, we don't want the downstream bridge to *also* create
a connector.  And if this driver did pass the NO_CONNECTOR flag (and we
supported that mode) this would change nothing.
