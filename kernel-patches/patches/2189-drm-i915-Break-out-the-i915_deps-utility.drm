Subject: [PATCH 2189/2399] drm/i915: Break out the i915_deps utility
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Since it's starting to be used outside the i915 TTM move code, move it
to a separate set of files.

v2:
- Update the documentation.
v4:
- Rebase.
