Subject: [PATCH 1962/2251] drm/vc4: kms: Ignore atomic_flush if we're disabled

atomic_flush will be called for each CRTC even if they aren't enabled.

The whole code we have there will thus run without a properly affected
channel, which can then result in all sorts of weird behaviour.

Fortunately, the DRM_PLANE_COMMIT_ACTIVE_ONLY flag will skip the CRTC
atomic_begin and atomic_flush, and the planes atomic_update, if they
aren't enabled.

Our plane atomic_update is a nop, and atomic_begin will copy the current
HVS channel to the vc4_crtc structure for the interrupt handler to
consume, but the handler won't run if the CRTC is disabled. So in the
end, it will only skip our CRTC atomic_flush, which is what we want.
