Subject: [PATCH 1/2] PCI/PM: Increase wait time after resume

PCIe r6.0 sec 6.6.1 prescribes that a device must be able to respond to
config requests within 1.0 s (PCI_RESET_WAIT) after exiting conventional
reset and this same delay is prescribed when coming out of D3cold (as that
involves reset too).

A device that requires more than 1 second to initialize after reset may
respond to config requests with Request Retry Status completions (sec
2.3.1), and we accommodate that in Linux with a 60 second cap
(PCIE_RESET_READY_POLL_MS).

Previously we waited up to PCIE_RESET_READY_POLL_MS only in the reset code
path, not in the resume path.  However, a device has surfaced, namely Intel
Titan Ridge xHCI, which requires a longer delay also in the resume code
path.

Make the resume code path to use this same extended delay as the reset
path.
