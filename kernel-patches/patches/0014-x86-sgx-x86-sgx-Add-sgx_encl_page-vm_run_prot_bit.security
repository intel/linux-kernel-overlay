Subject: [PATCH 14/38] x86/sgx: x86/sgx: Add sgx_encl_page->vm_run_prot_bits
 for dynamic permission changes

Enclave creators declare their enclave page permissions (EPCM
permissions) at the time the pages are added to the enclave. These
page permissions are the vetted permissible accesses of the enclave
pages and stashed off (in struct sgx_encl_page->vm_max_prot_bits)
for later comparison with enclave PTEs and VMAs.

Current permission support assume that EPCM permissions remain static
for the lifetime of the enclave. This is about to change with the
addition of support for SGX2 where the EPCM permissions of enclave
pages belonging to an initialized enclave may change during the
enclave's lifetime.

Support for changing of EPCM permissions should continue to respect
the vetted maximum protection bits maintained in
sgx_encl_page->vm_max_prot_bits. Towards this end, add
sgx_encl_page->vm_run_prot_bits in preparation for support of
enclave page permission changes. sgx_encl_page->vm_run_prot_bits
reflect the active EPCM permissions of an enclave page and are not to
exceed sgx_encl_page->vm_max_prot_bits.

Two permission fields are used: sgx_encl_page->vm_run_prot_bits
reflects the current EPCM permissions and is used to manage the page
table entries while sgx_encl_page->vm_max_prot_bits contains the vetted
maximum protection bits and is used to guide which EPCM permissions
are allowed in the upcoming SGX2 permission changing support (it guides
what values sgx_encl_page->vm_run_prot_bits may have).

Consider this example how sgx_encl_page->vm_max_prot_bits and
sgx_encl_page->vm_run_prot_bits are used:

(1) Add an enclave page with secinfo of RW to an uninitialized enclave:
    sgx_encl_page->vm_max_prot_bits = RW
    sgx_encl_page->vm_run_prot_bits = RW

    At this point RW VMAs would be allowed to access this page and PTEs
    would allow write access as guided by
    sgx_encl_page->vm_run_prot_bits.

(2) User space invokes SGX2 to change the EPCM permissions to read-only.
    This is allowed because sgx_encl_page->vm_max_prot_bits = RW:
    sgx_encl_page->vm_max_prot_bits = RW
    sgx_encl_page->vm_run_prot_bits = R

    At this point only new read-only VMAs would be allowed to access
    this page and PTEs would not allow write access as guided
    by sgx_encl_page->vm_run_prot_bits.

(3) User space invokes SGX2 to change the EPCM permissions to RX.
    This will not be supported by the kernel because
    sgx_encl_page->vm_max_prot_bits = RW:
    sgx_encl_page->vm_max_prot_bits = RW
    sgx_encl_page->vm_run_prot_bits = R

(3) User space invokes SGX2 to change the EPCM permissions to RW.
    This will be allowed because sgx_encl_page->vm_max_prot_bits = RW:
    sgx_encl_page->vm_max_prot_bits = RW
    sgx_encl_page->vm_run_prot_bits = RW

    At this point RW VMAs would again be allowed to access this page
    and PTEs would allow write access as guided by
    sgx_encl_page->vm_run_prot_bits.

struct sgx_encl_page hosting this information is maintained for each
enclave page so the space consumed by the struct is important.
The existing sgx_encl_page->vm_max_prot_bits is already unsigned long
while only using three bits. Transition to a bitfield for the two
members containing protection bits.

+the ``vm_max_prot_bits`` of that page. EPCM permissions are not allowed

 On systems supporting SGX2 EPCM permissions may change while the
 enclave page belongs to a VMA without impacting the VMA permissions.
 This means that a running VMA may appear to allow access to an enclave
