Subject: [PATCH 1609/2251] drm/doc: Clarify what ioctls can be used on render
 nodes

The documentation for render nodes indicates that only "PRIME-related"
ioctls are valid on render nodes, but the documentation does not clarify
what that means.  If the reader is not familiar with PRIME, they may
beleive this to be only the ioctls with "PRIME" in the name and not other
ioctls such as set of syncobj ioctls.  Clarify the situation for the
reader by referencing where the reader will find a current list of valid
ioctls.

 If a driver advertises render node support, DRM core will create a
 separate render node called renderD<num>. There will be one render node

 nodes are designed to avoid the buffer-leaks, which occur if clients
 guess the flink names or mmap offsets on the legacy interface.
 Additionally to this basic interface, drivers must mark their
