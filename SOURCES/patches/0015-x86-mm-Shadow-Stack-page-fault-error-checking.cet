Subject: [PATCH 15/46] x86/mm: Shadow Stack page fault error checking

Shadow stack accesses are those that are performed by the CPU where it
expects to encounter a shadow stack mapping.  These accesses are performed
implicitly by CALL/RET at the site of the shadow stack pointer.  These
accesses are made explicitly by shadow stack management instructions like
WRUSSQ.

Shadow stacks accesses to shadow-stack mapping can see faults in normal,
valid operation just like regular accesses to regular mappings.  Shadow
stacks need some of the same features like delayed allocation, swap and
copy-on-write.

Shadow stack accesses can also result in errors, such as when a shadow
stack overflows, or if a shadow stack access occurs to a non-shadow-stack
mapping.

In handling a shadow stack page fault, verify it occurs within a shadow
stack mapping.  It is always an error otherwise.  For valid shadow stack
accesses, set FAULT_FLAG_WRITE to effect copy-on-write.  Because clearing
_PAGE_DIRTY (vs. _PAGE_RW) is used to trigger the fault, shadow stack read
fault and shadow stack write fault are not differentiated and both are
handled as a write access.
