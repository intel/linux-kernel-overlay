Subject: [PATCH 047/223] dt-bindings: misc: hddl_dev: Add hddl device
 management documentation

Add hddl device management documentation

The HDDL client driver acts as an software RTC to sync with network time.
It abstracts xlink protocol to communicate with remote IA host.
This driver exports the details about sensors available in the platform
to remote IA host as xlink packets.
This driver also handles device connect/disconnect events and identifies
board id and soc id using gpio's based on platform configuration.
