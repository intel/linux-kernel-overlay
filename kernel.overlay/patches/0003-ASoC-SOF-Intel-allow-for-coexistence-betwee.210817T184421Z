Subject: [PATCH 03/26] ASoC: SOF: Intel: allow for coexistence between SOF and
 Atom/SST drivers

Now that we have all the support needed for coexistence between ACPI
drivers for Baytrail and Cherrytrail, remove mutual exclusion in the
Kconfig file. The selection is done by playing with the snd_intel_dsp
module parameter.

 	  This adds support for Sound Open Firmware for Intel(R) platforms
 	  using the Baytrail, Braswell or Cherrytrail processors.
-	  This option is mutually exclusive with the Atom/SST and Baytrail
-	  legacy drivers. If you want to enable SOF on Baytrail/Cherrytrail,
-	  you need to deselect those options first.
-	  SOF does not support Baytrail-CR for now, so this option is not
-	  recommended for distros. At some point all legacy drivers will be
-	  deprecated but not before all userspace firmware/topology/UCM files
-	  are made available to downstream distros.
+	  This option can coexist in the same build with the Atom legacy
+	  drivers, currently the default but which will be deprecated
+	  at some point.
+	  Existing firmware/topology binaries and UCM configurations
+	  typically located in the root file system are already
+	  compatible with both SOF or Atom/SST legacy drivers.
+	  This is a recommended option for distributions.
 	  Say Y if you want to enable SOF on Baytrail/Cherrytrail.
 	  If unsure select "N".
