Subject: [PATCH 226/330] drm/amd/display: fix type mismatch error for return
 variable

It is possible for ret_vsnprintf to be assigned negative value in
error cases. As an unsigned variable, negative values which
are stored in their 2's complement form gets treated as a positive
number. This will led to treating bad cases as good ones.
eg: -1 gets stored as 0xFFFFFFFF on a 32 bit system
