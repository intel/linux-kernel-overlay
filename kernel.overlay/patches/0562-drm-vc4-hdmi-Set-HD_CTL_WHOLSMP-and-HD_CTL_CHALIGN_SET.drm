Subject: [PATCH 0562/1423] drm/vc4: hdmi: Set HD_CTL_WHOLSMP and
 HD_CTL_CHALIGN_SET

Symptom is random switching of speakers when using multichannel.

Repeatedly running speakertest -c8 occasionally starts with
channels jumbled. This is fixed with HD_CTL_WHOLSMP.

The other bit looks beneficial and apears harmless in testing so
I'd suggest adding it too.

Documentation says: HD_CTL_WHILSMP_SET
Wait for whole sample. When this bit is set MAI transmit will start
only when there is at least one whole sample available in the fifo.

Documentation says: HD_CTL_CHALIGN_SET
Channel Align When Overflow. This bit is used to realign the audio
channels in case of an overflow.
If this bit is set, after the detection of an overflow, equal
amount of dummy words to the missing words will be written to fifo,
filling up the broken sample and maintaining alignment.
