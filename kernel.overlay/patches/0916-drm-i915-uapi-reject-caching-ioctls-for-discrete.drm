Subject: [PATCH 0916/1423] drm/i915/uapi: reject caching ioctls for discrete
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

It's a noop on DG1, and in the future when need to support other devices
which let us control the coherency, then it should be an immutable
creation time property for the BO. This will likely be controlled
through a new gem_create_ext extension.

v2: add some kernel doc for the discrete changes, and document the
    implicit rules

+ *     - Everything else is always allocated and mapped as write-back, with the
+ *       guarantee that everything is also coherent with the GPU.
+ *
+ * Note that this is likely to change in the future again, where we might need
+ * more flexibility on future devices, so making this all explicit as part of a
