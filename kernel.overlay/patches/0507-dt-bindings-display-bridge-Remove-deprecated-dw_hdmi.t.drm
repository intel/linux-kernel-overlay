-Synopsys DesignWare HDMI TX Encoder
-===================================
-
-This document defines device tree properties for the Synopsys DesignWare HDMI
-TX Encoder (DWC HDMI TX). It doesn't constitue a device tree binding
-specification by itself but is meant to be referenced by platform-specific
-device tree bindings.
-
-When referenced from platform device tree bindings the properties defined in
-this document are defined as follows. The platform device tree bindings are
-responsible for defining whether each property is required or optional.
-
-- reg: Memory mapped base address and length of the DWC HDMI TX registers.
-
-- reg-io-width: Width of the registers specified by the reg property. The
-  value is expressed in bytes and must be equal to 1 or 4 if specified. The
-  register width defaults to 1 if the property is not present.
-
-- interrupts: Reference to the DWC HDMI TX interrupt.
-
-- clocks: References to all the clocks specified in the clock-names property
-  as specified in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt.
-
-- clock-names: The DWC HDMI TX uses the following clocks.
-
-  - "iahb" is the bus clock for either AHB and APB (mandatory).
-  - "isfr" is the internal register configuration clock (mandatory).
-  - "cec" is the HDMI CEC controller main clock (optional).
-
-- ports: The connectivity of the DWC HDMI TX with the rest of the system is
-  expressed in using ports as specified in the device graph bindings defined
-  in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/graph.txt. The numbering of the ports
-  is platform-specific.
