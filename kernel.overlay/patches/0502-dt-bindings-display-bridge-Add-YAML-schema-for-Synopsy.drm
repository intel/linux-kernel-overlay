Subject: [PATCH 0502/2740] dt-bindings: display: bridge: Add YAML schema for
 Synopsys DW-HDMI

Add a .yaml schema containing the common properties for the Synopsys
DesignWare HDMI TX controller. This isn't a full device tree binding
specification, but is meant to be referenced by platform-specific
bindings for the IP core.

+description: |
+  This document defines device tree properties for the Synopsys DesignWare HDMI
+  TX controller (DWC HDMI TX) IP core. It doesn't constitute a full device tree
+  binding specification by itself but is meant to be referenced by device tree
+  bindings for the platform-specific integrations of the DWC HDMI TX.
+
+  When referenced from platform device tree bindings the properties defined in
+  this document are defined as follows. The platform device tree bindings are
+  responsible for defining whether each property is required or optional.
+
+properties:
+  reg:
+    maxItems: 1
+
+  reg-io-width:
+    description:
+      Width (in bytes) of the registers specified by the reg property.

+      - $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32
+      - enum: [1, 4]
+    default: 1
