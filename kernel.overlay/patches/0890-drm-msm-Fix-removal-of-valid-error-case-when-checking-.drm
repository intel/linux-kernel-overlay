Subject: [PATCH 0890/2740] drm/msm: Fix removal of valid error case when
 checking speed_bin

Commit 7bf168c8fe8c  ("drm/msm: Fix speed-bin support not to
access outside valid memory"), reworked the nvmem reading of
"speed_bin", but in doing so dropped handling of the -ENOENT
case which was previously documented as "fine".

That change resulted in the db845c board display to fail to
start, with the following error:

adreno 5000000.gpu: [drm:a6xx_gpu_init] *ERROR* failed to read speed-bin (-2). Some OPPs may not be supported by hardware

Thus, this patch simply re-adds the ENOENT handling so the lack
of the speed_bin entry isn't fatal for display, and gets things
working on db845c.
