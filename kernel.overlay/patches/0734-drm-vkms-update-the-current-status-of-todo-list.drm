Subject: [PATCH 0734/1423] drm/vkms: update the current status of todo list

Update:
- debugging issues on igt testcases
- plane composition features: add primary plane improvements
- suggestions of good tasks to start working on vkms

Drop:
- syzkaller bug report:
  what triggered the warning was replaced by shmem functions at
  https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/394614/
- overlay plane: this feature was added by
  https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/430941/
